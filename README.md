AI Accountability Reference

This repository provides structured references related to:

- AI governance
- Irreversible decision risk
- Refusal authority
- Singularity risk
- Institutional responsibility
- Post-incident review structures

This material is descriptive and non-prescriptive.

This repository provides neutral reference material related to accountability, oversight, and review structures for high-impact autonomous and AI-driven systems.

It does not propose policy, regulation, or normative ethical frameworks.
It does not advocate adoption, restriction, or intervention.

The purpose of this repository is to clarify structural questions that commonly arise in post-incident reviews, audit processes, governance assessments, and institutional evaluations involving AI-enabled decision systems.

Context

In cases involving high-impact autonomous decisions, institutions often face recurring questions related to:

Decision authority and final refusal points

Oversight structure and human intervention capacity

Audit logging and record preservation

Accountability attribution

Procedural delay and cooling-off mechanisms

Responsibility distribution within organizations

Repeatability and precedent formation

Institutional review validity

This repository consolidates reference concepts and procedural descriptions relevant to those contexts.

Scope

The materials here are:

Structural, not ideological

Institutional, not technological

Non-normative and non-binding

No implementation guidance, enforcement model, or compliance requirement is implied.

Typical Use Contexts

This material may be relevant in situations such as:

Post-incident accountability review

Institutional audit of AI decision processes
